Git is so cool!
This is the first time I am actually learning git, and
not feeling completely lost or overwhelemd. 
Did it once and it was really confusing.
But now it feels super natural.
I added this line in the update-readme branch.
More commits more adds and more branches! We love trees and pushes!
This is a new line: HI!
